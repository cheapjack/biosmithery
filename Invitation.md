## Invitation

Artist [Sam Meech](http://smeech.co.uk/) is running an interactive video workshop on Lancaster University campus for BLS associates, researchers, students and teachers.

[Isadora](https://troikatronix.com/) is a powerful but very user friendly interactive video software that can be used to developed a variety of creative and technical projects. It can be used for projection mapping, interactive installation, VJing (thatâ€™s DJing with video), but also contains  some super simple camera tracking tools. 

This workshop will explore ways to use live camera inputs in a lab environment to 

 * Generate useful data
 * Generate awesome visuals that can be used for things like public engagement, teaching or play. 
 
Hopefully with this workshop you'll give you the confidence to build your own tools, either for art or research or both!
