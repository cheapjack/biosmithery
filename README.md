[Sam Meech](http://smeech.co.uk/) is running a workshop for BLS associates, researchers, students and teachers at LICA to introduce [Isadora](https://troikatronix.com/get-it/) a powerful but very user friendly interactive video software that can be used to develop a variety of creative and technical projects. 

It can be used for projection mapping, interactive installation, VJing, but also contains some super simple camera tracking tools that is a playful *"live"* alternative to more processing heavy tools like [IdTracker](http://www.idtracker.es). 

This workshop will explore ways to use live camera inputs in a lab environment to a) generate useful data and b) generate awesome visuals. 

Hopefully with this workshop you'll get the confidence to build your own tools, either for art or research or both! This is really an introductory session, so please don’t worry if you’re new at all to interactive / video software. 

## Getting Started

BRING SOME HEADPHONES - if possible 

As part of prep, we’ll use the first half hour to just get everyone set up with the software and some sample media. Please feel free to bring your own images, sounds and video clips too.
