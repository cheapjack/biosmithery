Resources, invitation and overview for Sam Meech's interactive video workshop at Lancaster University.

## Invitation

### Wednesday 18th September 2019 11-4pm 

#### RoomLIC - LICA A40 Computer Lab

Artist [Sam Meech](http://smeech.co.uk/) is running an interactive video workshop on Lancaster University campus for BLS associates, researchers, students and teachers.

[Isadora](https://troikatronix.com/) is a powerful but very user friendly interactive video software that can be used to developed a variety of creative and technical projects. It can be used for projection mapping, interactive installation, VJing (that’s DJing with video), but also contains  some super simple camera tracking tools. 

This workshop will explore ways to use live camera inputs in a lab environment to 

 * Generate useful data
 * Generate awesome visuals that can be used for things like public engagement, teaching or play. 
 
Hopefully with this workshop you'll give you the confidence to build your own tools, either for art or research or both!

## Getting Started

Bring some headphones if possible 

As part of prep, we’ll use the first half of the workshop to just get everyone set up with the software and some sample media. Please feel free to bring your own images, sounds and video clips too.

You can download and install the software ahead of attending by visiting the Isadora site:

And if you fancy familiarising yourself with the basics, there is a great 10 min intro video [here](https://support.troikatronix.com/support/solutions/articles/13000022367-video-tutorial-1-the-basics) (for an older version of the software, but still generally applies)
